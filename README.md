# simple-client-server-chat
This simple chat application is made by using socket programming in C.
Compiled, when running the Client/Server we need to specify a port as the argument, same for both.
If you wanna test in local just copypaste & run, otherwise you'll need to change the loopback
address with the one of your own server machine.
